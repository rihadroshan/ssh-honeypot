2. Generate a host key for the SSH server if you don't have one:

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f server.key
```

## Usage

Run the honeypot server with the following command:

### Basic Usage

```sh
python3 main.py -a <address> -p <port>
```

By default, the honeypot will use the username `root`.

### Usage with Custom Authentication

```sh
python3 main.py -a <address> -p <port> -u <username> -w <password>
```
